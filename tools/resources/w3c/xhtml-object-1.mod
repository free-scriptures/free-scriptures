     Notes

     This version:
     http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231

     This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
     2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this
     license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves
     information on style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ,
     reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this
     specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of
     "use". See the older formulation for the policy prior to this date. Please
     see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our
     site, such as the translating or annotating specifications.

<!-- Embedded Objects

        object

     This module declares the object element type and its attributes, used
     to embed external objects as part of XHTML pages. In the document,
     place param elements prior to other content within the object element.

     Note that use of this module requires instantiation of the Param
     Element Module.
