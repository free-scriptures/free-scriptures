Description
-----------

xsltransformator1 is a Java wrapper for XSLT processing (XML transformation by a stylesheet). It is provided by https://github.com/skreutzer/automated_digital_publishing/.


Requirements
------------

A proper Java SDK must be installed to produce the *.class files. The source code is at least compatible with Java 1.6 and 1.7 (OpenJDK).


Build
-----

Type

    make

in the directory containing the package's source code.


Execution
---------

Type

    java xsltransformator1 in-file stylesheet-file out-file

in the xsltransformator1 directory, or anywhere on the shell if the path to the xsltransformator1 directory is appended to the CLASSPATH environment variable.


Usage
-----

If external entities are referenced in the XML input file, you have to obtain the external entity file and configure it in $/entities/config.xml of the xsltransformator1 installation directory. The structure of the configuration file is

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <xsltransformator1-config>
      <entity>
        <resolve identifier="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" reference="xhtml1-strict.dtd"/>
        <resolve identifier="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" reference="xhtml1-strict.dtd"/>
      </entity>
    </xsltransformator1-config>
    
Each <resolve> element defines the expected public or system identifier and resolves it with the "reference" attribute to a local file. The path to the local file might be absolute or relative to the $/entities/ directory of the xsltransformator1 installation directory. $/entities/config_xhtml1-strict.xml is an example for XHTML 1.0 Strict, which would need to be renamed to config.xml, while xhtml1-strict.dtd, xhtml-lat1.ent, xhtml-symbol.ent and xhtml-special.ent would need to be placed in the $/entities/ directory.
